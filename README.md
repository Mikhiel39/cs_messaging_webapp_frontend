# CS Messaging App
It's a real-time chat application for multiple agents who provide support to multiple customers who can create queries and then some agent will be alloted to a query to solve issue by real time messaging with that customer. It also tag urgent messages based on important strings appearing in their chats.

## Implemented features
- Scheme to help agents divide work amongst themselves & to prevent multiple agents working on the same message at once.
- To surface messages that are more urgent and in need of immediate attention using "Urgent" tag.
- Search functionality to allow agents to search over messages and customers.
- To surface additional information about customers.
- Using socket.io, so that new incoming messages can show up in real time
